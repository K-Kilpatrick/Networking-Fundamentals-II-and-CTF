Hello, Kelly

Well-done on the submission of your Module 9 homework assignment, in this challenge you evaluated issues that exist within a DNS infrastructure.

Please note the below:

Mission 2:

The new SPF record needs to include the new IP such as: "v=spf1 a mx a:mail.wise-advice.com mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.23.176.21 ip4:45.63.4.215 ip4:104.207.135.156 ~all"

Mission 3:

The subpage of resistance.theforce.net isn't redirecting because there isn't a CNAME for it.

A CNAME record should be added such as: resistance.theforce.net CNAME theforce.net

In conclusion:

Please look at the correction provided in my response, see if you can see where you went wrong..

Finally:

Keep up this level of excellence, should you need clarity on certain topics reach-out to your instructional team, alternatively use the askBCS service as well as tutoring, this will enhance your chances of success
